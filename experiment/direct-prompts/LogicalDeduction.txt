Task Description: You are given a problem description. The task is to parse the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, defining the domain, variables, and contraints. Please provide a program directly in the example format, other textual expressions like "The logic program for each problem is presented below:" should not be included in your answer.
When defining numerical values in Domain, please ensure they conform to intuitive notions of magnitude. For example, "newest" (i.e., the smallest age) should be defined as 1, and "cheapest" (i.e., the smallest price) should also be defined as 1.

Problem:
The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn an antique car show, there are three vehicles: a station wagon, a convertible, and a minivan. The station wagon is the oldest. The minivan is newer than the convertible.
Question:
Which of the following is true?
Options:
A) The station wagon is the second-newest.
B) The convertible is the second-newest.
C) The minivan is the second-newest.
###
Domain:
1: newest
3: oldest
Variables:
station_wagon [IN] [1, 2, 3]
convertible [IN] [1, 2, 3]
minivan [IN] [1, 2, 3]
Constraints:
station_wagon == 3 ::: The station wagon is the oldest.
minivan > convertible ::: The minivan is newer than the convertible.
AllDifferentConstraint([station_wagon, convertible, minivan]) ::: All vehicles have different values.
Query:
A) station_wagon == 2 ::: The station wagon is the second-newest.
B) convertible == 2 ::: The convertible is the second-newest.
C) minivan == 2 ::: The minivan is the second-newest.

The robin is to the left of the raven. The quail is the rightmost. The raven is the third from the left.
Question:
Which of the following is true?
Options:
A) The quail is the rightmost.
B) The owl is the rightmost.
C) The raven is the rightmost.
D) The falcon is the rightmost.
E) The robin is the rightmost.
