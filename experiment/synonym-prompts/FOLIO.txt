You are tasked with parsing natural language statements into First-Order Logic (FOL) while maintaining a consistent symbol definition table. Follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Predicate Definition Table**: Begin with an empty table containing columns: "Predicate," "Predicate Meaning," and "Appearing Sentences."

2. **Translate Each Sentence**:
   - Convert each sentence into an accurate logic parse.
   - Check the Symbol (Include Predicate and Constant) Definition Table:
      1. If an existing symbol has the same meaning, update your logic parse to reuse it (synonyms in different expressions should use the same symbol).
      2. If an existing symbol’s meaning is encompassed by the current one (e.g., existing: "x goes to school"; current: "x goes to school and joined a club"), update your logic parse to reuse the existing symbol. 
      3. If an existing symbol’s meaning encompasses the current one (e.g., existing: "x goes to school and joins a club"; current: "x goes to school"), replace the definition in the table with the current symbol’s definition. 
      4. If the current symbol is entirely new , add it to the table.
    - Every time when you replace one row in the table with a new one, clear the column "Appearing Sentences" in the table and restart the convert from the first sentence.
    - Every time when you provid a logic parse, start a Symbol Check.

3. **Final Output**:
   - Provide:
     - The completed predicate definition table.
     - Logic Parse.
       - Premises.
       - Question.

## Step 1: Initialize the Symbol Definition Table
We begin with an empty table containing the columns "Symbol", "Symbol Meaning", and "Appearing Sentences."

| Symbol | Symbol Meaning | Appearing Sentences |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
|        |                |                     |

## Step 2: Convert Each Sentence

### Sentence 1: "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
Logic Parse: 
  PopularNetflix(ST)
Symbol Check:
1. Symbol: PopularNetflix(x)
   Meaning: x is a popular Netflix show
   Table Check: Table is empty, no existing Symbols.
   Rule 4: Current Symbol is entirely new.
2. Symbol: ST
   Meaning: Stranger Things
   Table Check: Table is empty, no existing Symbols.
   Rule 4: Current Symbol is entirely new.
**Update the Symbol Definition Table**: Add the new symbols.
  
| Symbol             | Symbol Meaning              | Appearing Sentences |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| PopularNetflix(x) | x is a popular Netflix show | Sentence 1          |
| ST                | "Stranger Things"           | Sentence 1          |

**Continue to Convert Next Sentence**

### Sentence 2: If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.
Logic Parse: 
  ∀x (PopularNetflix(x) → BingeWatch(k, x))
Symbol Check:
1. Symbol: PopularNetflix(x)
   Meaning: x is a popular Netflix show
   Table Check: Exists with same meaning and arity 
   Rule 1: Reuse.
**Already the same predicate, no need to update FOL**
2. Symbol: BingeWatch(k, x)
   Meaning: Karen binge-watches show x
   Table Check: Not in table.
   Rule 4: Current predicate is entirely new.
3. Symbol: k
   Meaning: Karen
   Table Check: Not in table.
   Rule 4: Current predicate is entirely new.
**Update the Symbol Definition Table**: Add BingeWatch(k, x), k and update PopularNetflix(x)’s appearing sentences.

| Symbol             | Symbol Meaning              | Appearing Sentences |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| PopularNetflix(x) | x is a popular Netflix show | Sentence 1, 2       |
| ST                | "Stranger Things"           | Sentence 1          |
| BingeWatch(k, x)  | Karen binge-watches show x  | Sentence 2          |
| k                 | Karen                       | Sentence 2          |

### Sentence 3: If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.
Logic Parse: 
  ∀x (NetflixShow(x) → (BingeWatch(k, x) ↔ Download(k, x)))
Symbol Check:
1. Symbol: NetflixShow(x)
   Meaning: x is a Netflix show
   Table Check: PopularNetflix(x) (x is a popular Netflix show) encompasses "x is a Netflix show and popular," so it includes NetflixShow(x). 
   Rule 3: Existing predicate’s meaning encompasses the current one. replace the definition in the table with the current predicate’s definition.

**Update the Symbol Definition Table**: Replace PopularNetflix(x) with NetflixShow(x)
| Symbol             | Symbol Meaning              | Appearing Sentences |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| NetflixShow(x)     | x is a Netflix show         | Sentence 1, 2       |
| ST                | "Stranger Things"           | Sentence 1          |
| BingeWatch(k, x)  | Karen binge-watches show x  | Sentence 2          |
| k                 | Karen                       | Sentence 2          |

**Replaced one row in the table with a new one.**
**Clear the column "Appearing Sentences" in the table and restart the convert from the first sentence**

| Symbol             | Symbol Meaning              | Appearing Sentences |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| NetflixShow(x)    | x is a Netflix show         |                     |
| ST                | "Stranger Things"           |                     |
| BingeWatch(k, x)  | Karen binge-watches show x  |                     |
| k                 | Karen                       |                     |

## Restart Step 2: Convert Each Sentence

### Sentence 1: "Stranger Things" is a popular Netflix show.
Logic Parse:
  PopularNetflix(ST)
Symbol Check:
  1. Symbol: PopularNetflix(x)
   Meaning: x is a popular Netflix show
   Table Check: NetflixShow(x)'s meaning is encompassed by PopularNetflix(x) 
   Rule 2: Update logic parse to reuse
**Update the Logic Parse**:
To reuse NetflixShow(x) instead of using PopularNetflix, the new Logic Parse will be:
  NetflixShow(ST) ∧ Popular(ST)
Symbol Check:    
1. Symbol: NetflixShow(x)  
   Meaning: Stranger Things  
   Table Check: Exists in the table with the same meaning.  
   Rule 1: Reuse.  
2. Symbol: ST  
   Meaning: x is a Netflix show  
   Table Check: Exists in the table with the same meaning.  
   Rule 1: Reuse NetflixShow(x).  
3. Symbol: Popular(x)  
   Meaning: x is popular   
   Table Check: Not in the table.  
   Rule 4: Current predicate is entirely new.

**Update the Symbol Definition Table**:  
Add Popular(x) and update NetflixShow(x)’s appearing sentences.

| Symbol             | Symbol Meaning              | Appearing Sentences |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| NetflixShow(x)    | x is a Netflix show         | Sentence 1          |

   Table Check: Exists with same meaning.
   Rule 1: Reuse

4. Symbol: k
   Meaning: Karen
   Table Check: Exists with same meaning.
   Rule 1: Reuse

**Update Symbol Table**: Add Sentence 2 to relevant symbols’ "Appearing Sentences".
| Symbol           | Symbol Meaning             | Appearing Sentences    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| NetflixShow(x)   | x is a Netflix show        | Sentence 1, Sentence 2 |
| ST               | "Stranger Things"          | Sentence 1             |
| BingeWatch(k, x) | Karen binge-watches show x | Sentence 2             |
| k                | Karen                      | Sentence 2             |
| Popular(x)       | x is popular               | Sentence 1, Sentence 2 |

### Sentence 3: If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it.

Logic Parse:
∀x (NetflixShow(x) → (BingeWatch(k, x) ↔ Download(k, x)))

Symbol Check:

   Table Check: Exists with same meaning.
   Rule 1: Reuse

4. Symbol: Download(k, x)
   Meaning: Karen downloads show x
   Table Check: Does not exist
   Rule 4: Current predicate is entirely new


**Update Symbol Definition Table**: Add relevant symbols with Sentence 3.

| Symbol           | Symbol Meaning             | Appearing Sentences                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| NetflixShow(x)   | x is a Netflix show        | Sentence 1, Sentence 2, Sentence 3 |
| ST               | "Stranger Things"          | Sentence 1                         |
| BingeWatch(k, x) | Karen binge-watches show x | Sentence 2, Sentence 3, Sentence 3 |
| k                | Karen                      | Sentence 2, Sentence 3             |
