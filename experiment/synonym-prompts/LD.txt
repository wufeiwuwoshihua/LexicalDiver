You are given a problem description involving a set of entities and their relative properties or positions. Your task is to represent the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem in five steps:

1. Synonym Variable Table    
   • Scan the context and identify all concept expressions that refer to the same underlying Unified Variable (e.g. “television” and “TV”).  
   • Create a Markdown table with two columns: the unified Variable name and all its synonyms from the context.

2. Domain:
   • Define the numeric range for relevant qualities (e.g., position, age, price) using intuitive magnitudes.
   • For example: `1` should represent the *newest* (smallest age) or *leftmost*, and `N` the *oldest* or *rightmost*, where N is the number of entities.

3. Variables:
   • List each entity as a variable.
   • Specify the domain of values each variable can take.
   • Use the format: `Entity [IN] [1, ..., N]`

4. Constraints:
   • Translate each explicit and implicit constraint from the problem into a formal condition.
   • Use relational expressions (`==`, `<`, `>`, etc.) with brief English explanations.
   • Always include an `AllDifferentConstraint([...])` when applicable to enforce uniqueness.

5. Query:
   • Convert each multiple-choice answer into a query condition.
   • Use format: `OptionLabel) Expression ::: English interpretation`

### Example Input 
Problem:
The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn an antique car show, there are three vehicles: a station wagon, a convertible, and a minivan. The station wagon is the oldest. The minivan is newer than the convertible.
Question:
Which of the following is true?
Options:
A) The station wagon is the second-newest.
B) The convertible is the second-newest.
C) The minivan is the second-newest.
