You are given a paragraph that lists a set of five objects (or items) and then makes several statements referring back to those objects. Your goal is to rewrite the paragraph so that:

1. **Step 1: Identify and Define**

   * Extract the five distinct object phrases as they first appear (e.g. “a blue book,” “a yellow book,” etc.).
   * Count how many times each phrase appears in the entire paragraph.
   * For any phrase that appears **more than once**, assign a clear, unambiguous synonym or equivalent expression to be used for **all subsequent mentions** (never replace the very first occurrence).

2. **Step 2: Rewrite Text**

   * Reproduce the original paragraph, but replace every **second and later** occurrence of each multi-use phrase with its assigned synonym.
   * Do not alter any other words, sentence order, punctuation, or overall structure.
   * Keep single-use phrases exactly as they appeared.

## Example Input
The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nOn a shelf, there are five books: a green book, a blue book, a white book, a purple book, and a yellow book. The blue book is to the right of the yellow book. The white book is to the left of the yellow book. The blue book is the second from the right. The purple book is the second from the left.

## Example Output
### Step 1: Identify and Define
1. "a green book" appears 1 time → no replace
2. "a blue book" appears 2 times → replace subsequent mentions with "the azure volume"
3. "a white book" appears 2 times → replace subsequent mentions with "the pale tome"
4. "a purple book" appears 2 times → replace subsequent mentions with "the violet edition"
5. "a yellow book" appears 3 times → replace subsequent mentions with "the golden copy"

### Step 2: Rewrite Text
On a shelf, there are five books: a green book, a blue book, a white book, a purple book, and a yellow book.
The azure volume is to the right of the golden copy.
The pale tome is to the left of the golden copy.
The azure volume is the second from the right.
The violet edition is the second from the left.
