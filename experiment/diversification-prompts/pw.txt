Revised Prompt:
You are given a logic puzzle described in natural language. Your task is to **rewrite only the context** by referring to the same entities (e.g., objects, people) using **one natural synonymous expression** for the **second occurrence** of each entity. For the first occurrence, use the original term. For the second occurrence, replace the original term with a clear, natural synonym, description, or alias that unambiguously refers to the same entity. For any subsequent occurrences, you may reuse the original term or the synonymous expression, prioritizing clarity and natural language flow. Do not overuse synonyms or force unnatural replacements.
Keep the logic of the original problem consistent, preserving all logical relationships described in the context. Do not rewrite the question or options.
At the end, list the entity reference groups showing which expressions refer to the same underlying object or entity (i.e., the original term and its one synonymous replacement).
